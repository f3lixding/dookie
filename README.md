## What is this?
This is a daemon, a web application server and everything I can think of to run on my 2018 macbook pro 13 that I have lying around. I mainly use it to manage my Plex server and everything around it.
It's also just an excuse for me to write crappy rust.

## What does it do now?
Currently it does the following:
- Moves files from their temporary location to the specified permanent location after specified amount of time
- Ensures that it is safe to call scans on Plex by checking to see if there are any broken symlinks. If it is safe, calls for Plex to refresh it library (this is a WIP).

In the future, I want it to also do the following:
- Curates a list of files to delete based on specified criteria.
- Deletes them when it's time (with the way I had set things up this means a bit more than just rm file).
- Terminates any ongoing items in the torrent client (i.e. download and upload) when there are ongoing remote sessions. This also includes intercepting and caching requests issued by index managers.
- Resumes any ongoing items in the torrent client when no remote sessions are detected.
